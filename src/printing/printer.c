 *****Program description
 * This printer function could be activated wit a status of 0 which means
 * start. Once started messages strings to be printed could be sent to the
 * printer with a status code of 1. which means add to que. And finally when
 * it is time to print the funciton could be called with a status of 2, whihc
 * means print what is in the que. If the que is full before 2 is sent, it will
 * auto print and go back to the begning of the que.
 */

/*
 ******Flow Text
 * -- First call the funciton with no toprint message and a status of 0,
 *     which will Open the printer
 * -- The next time you want a message to be stored to a que call the
 *     function with a status of 1
 * -- And once you are done call the function with no message and the
 *     status of 2 to flush everything to screen with the write system call
 */

/*
 ******Disclaimer
 * if you sent a status of 0 more than once before printing, you might loose
 * data as it will restart the printer
